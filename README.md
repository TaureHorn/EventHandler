# ðŸŒˆ Events Tracker ðŸŒˆ
Group project for [The Developer Academy](https://thedeveloperacademy.com/) Web Dev bootcamp. We were given a week to design and create a website for tracking events using the MERN stack.

Apologies in advance for the eye searing hot pink. It's certainly a *choice*. But when you're given a week to build a full stack web app for the first time, there's not a lot of time for color palette considerations.
